          <h2>Brief Synopsis of Ways of Seeing</h2>
          <p>	Created by John Berger in 1972, Ways of Seeing is a video series consisting 
            of four sections, which all bring forth the idea that art is subjective; this 
            prompts us to look at art, and the world around us, in a different point of view. </p>

      <div class="column middle" style="background-color:#d8d8d8;">
          <h2>Concepts and Analysis</h2>
          <p>Out of the four episodes, the first sparked my interest. The aforementioned 
            primarily discusses philosopher Walter Benjamin’s text The Work of Art in the 
            Age of Mechanical Reproduction, in which Benjamin defines that each work of art 
            has its own distinctive aura. This “aura” can be experienced when the particular 
            art piece is in its original, intended form and in its intended “space and time”. 
            However, this aura can be altered when massively reproduced. The art piece is 
            now stripped of its original form/material and is in an entirely different place, 
            to be seen by people with, most likely, completely different cultural backgrounds. 
            Berger uses this to exemplify his argument that mass reproduction of art may nullify 
            or lessen the sense of “worth” that a piece of art may have because it is so easily accessible to the public. </p>

          <h2>Thoughts</h2>
          <p>This specific topic intrigued me because I love photography
            and graphic design and I find that whenever I look back on old photos 
            that I took or designs I made, I feel a certain nostalgia because I have memories of that 
            piece. However, due to the change and the passage of time, they may hold a new meaning 
            for me. I also find it interesting that no matter who looks at the photos I take, every 
            single individual will have a different perspective and emotional responses.</p>
