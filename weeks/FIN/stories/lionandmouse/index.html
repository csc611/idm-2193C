    <div>
      <p>There was once a brown Mouse.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p> Mouse was going home when he ran by Lion, who was sleeping.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Lion woke up and pounced on Mouse.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>"Please let me live," said Mouse.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>"I am only a small, brown mouse! If you let me live, maybe I will be able to help you in the future one day."</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The Lion laughed at Mouse. How could a small, brown mouse help her, the Lion?</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>A few days later, Lion got caught in a hunter's trap. She was tied to a tree, sad and hurt.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Just then, Mouse passed by. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>He saw her in the trap and start to chew away the ropes.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Lion was free!</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><i>"We should help each other, whoever it be, no matter the size."</i></p>
