    <div>
      <p>Once, the Wind and the Sun were arguing about who was stronger.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>"Surely I am the stronger one," said the Wind.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Then, they saw a traveller come down the path.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>"I know how to find out who is stronger, once and for all," said the Sun.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>"Whoever can make the traveller take off his cloak is the stronger one. You can start first, Wind."</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The Sun moved behind the clouds, and the Wind began to huff and puff at the traveller.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The harsher the Wind blew, the more the traveller wrapped his cloak around him, shivering.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>After a while, the Wind said sadly, "I must give up now."</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Just then, the Sun came out from beind the clouds and shone her warm light on the traveller.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The traveller smiled in joy at the shining sun and took off his cloak.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><i>"Kindness has more effects than harshness."</i></p>
    </div>
